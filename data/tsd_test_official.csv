This is an idiot masquerading as a compassionate intellect.
Didn't you happen to notice that the Conservatives are morons?
why don't you reveal why you dislike the mayor so much?   you thought that he screwed you in than land condemnation but really it was your fault but you continue to blame him and the city for your stupidity.  you are malicious and vindictive.

"The DOT are so INCOMPETENT is insane.  Yes SYNCH Lights and how about IMPROVING the traffic flow ?  You would think if your job was to help traffic flow that ANYONE with common sense and a BRAIN could do better than the clowns we currently have.  

Its like the DOT employees and management never drive around this island and witness all the problems that could be fixed and improved.  Hawaii needs some serious help or at least come competent workers in the DOT !"

I posted in this forum almost a decade ago that this would be the result of Liberal green energy schemes.

But all the socialists, liberals and progressives in this forum called me stupid.

Oh well..."
Isn't the alt-right fake news terrorist propaganda as well? Surely something can be done about it to save society from stupid people.
"yeah he is a moron.  him and krooked kathleen.  see these 2 fools at the airport, handing out winter coats and boots.  such a farce.  they should be ashamed of themselves but instead they are globe trotting and hiding as too afraid of getting lynched.  trudeau is back but hopefully the UN will take him and his selfies"
"Yes, seeing each other's face is part of communications, but it's not compulsory, nor should it be. Like most things in our society, it's a matter of freedom of choice. We manage to communicate just fine sitting beside each other,  or in the dark. This compulsory 'must see the other person's face' thing is sheer bullshit, and an excuse for bigots and misogynists to support the oppression of a small group of Muslim women."
Children lead by a feckless dimwit.
"Trump is so hypocritical. It is campaign rhetoric and his debasing comments towards women, minorities and the disabled, among others, that have given the rasicist and white supremacists the push they need to come out en masses."
"This is a perfect example of the RG mocking Christianity..... by not making a simple grammar edit from ""feast""  to ""festival"", they maliciously embarrass an obvious ESL christian.  Pathetic.

A sociopathic idiot is trying to 'reassure us.'"
"No - Trump is very stupid, among other explitives - he just accidentally made the right decision to pull out of the Paris nonsense."
Lead contained entirely within the range and cleaned up at regular intervals?  /facepalm at your idiocy.
So you agree that black children should be killed. I got it. So much for innocent until proven guilty. That is a white privilege too.
That's rich coming from a country that elected the village idiot for PM.
OMG trump is one resounding IDIOT !!!!!!

The Ontario liberals are c o m m u n i s t s … their agenda has been to make energy unaffordable in an effort to cripple industry while creating dependence on the state … liberals are anti-capitalists and they are beholden to OPSEU for getting them elected … living in Ontario is like living in Venezuela - it sucks!
Clown?  The only clowns who were elected are currently in New Jersey and Washington.
is that when assholes rise to the top of the organisation?
"What a hypocritical horse's arse. The hysterical and pathetic part is he is signing these executive actions with his party controlling both houses. Master of the Deal more like master of nothing.

Things he said about Obama and executive actions:

""Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?""

""I don't think he even tries anymore,"" Trump said of President Barack Obama in December 2015. ""I think he just signs executive actions.""

This one is the best...

""You know, it's supposed to be negotiated,"" Trump told CNN in January 2016. ""You're supposed to cajole, get people in a room, you have Republicans, Democrats, you're supposed to get together and pass a law. (Obama) doesn't want to do that because it's too much work. So he doesn't want to work too hard. He wants to go back and play golf."""
"So....morons protestors blocked I-5 today near Bellingham.  The result was a four mile, hours long backup.  Oh...and to add to your pathetic protest whining...you were responsible for a terrible rollover accident in the backup that trapped two women in their van.  The first responders had to drive the wrong way on the freeway to get to them and were delayed doing so.  The women were extricated from their vehicle and taken to the hospital in serious condition.  So, social justice warriors are you proud of yourself...say tough crap for these women?  And what exactly would you say if it were your family member or friend?  You idiots are breaking the law by doing this crap..you make th choice, you had better be able to live with it...and probably going to jail for your lawlessness.  Civil disobedience is against the law for a reason...remember that when you engage in it.  We have run out of patience for you worthless crap heads and this will end.  It's up to you how it does...."
Trudeau is treating Canadians like idiots. There will still be cash for access but it will be different somehow. These are the thoughts of a pot head . Would journalists please find out how much and when he is smoking weed.
"Live by the gun. Die by the gun. Same for stupidity. Gonna love the boring retirement life of 6 walls staring at you, schmuck."
We all deserve better.   To bad there wasn't a tax on stupidity and an even greater tax on those that voted for Dalton/Wynne destructive tag team.
Republican White House plus republican senate plus republican house equals one big zero. The three ring circus tent is coming apart at the seams. You would get more cooperation from a bunch of kindergarteners. This is what you get when you give absolute power to a bunch of idiots.
"So, tired of winning yet....losers."
Can't imagine how many people will come out of the woodwork for 10 million. There are a lot of desperate Americans out there. Then what? For each potential case Flynt will have to prove that it is true. By then Trump will be out of office. We talking years. Idiot.
"It was always Trudeau's intension not to change the rules. He promised to do so just to get NDP support in the last election, which he did. He played NDP supporters for fools and as such all Canadians will suffer until the next election"
You cannot legislate stupidity!
How ridiculous! And the kid who hit him? Also an idiot.
"A pathetic comment, in the extreme.  Why don't you shift your sorry posterior down to Ottawa and say something derogatory about his wife to his face?  Go for it, tough guy."
"""Allie"":  What land are you referring to? In any case, your first - proven incorrect claim - was that OHA uses ""tax payer"" funds for grants. You are wrong, and I repeat either ignorant or lying."
A discussion on Nextdoor got pretty testy the other day with claims that those of us who are concerned about illegal fireworks being told we were unpatriotic. Some of my neighbors are idiots.
"On the other side of the coin:

""A judge has reopened a major legal controversy by ruling that accused people can claim they were too drunk to be found culpable of committing crimes.
Presiding over a sexual assault case in Southwestern Ontario, Mr. Justice Terrence Patterson of the Superior Court of Ontario ruled that Parliament violated the Charter of Rights with a 1995 law that prohibits the so-called defence of excessive intoxication.
The ruling opened the door for Carl Frederick Fleming, 62, to argue that he was too drunk to appreciate his actions when he sexually assaulted a St. Thomas, Ont., woman in 2009.""

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/judge-reinstates-controversial-drunkenness-defence-in-sex-assault-case/article578863/

So, in this case one of the old boys club (aka judges) decided that a man can be too drunk to sexually assault someone..but on the other hand, a woman who is too drunk to control her own bladder can consent to sex.
Something has to change."
"because at some point, the government will make a decision to cut something.  Cuts hurt someone.  Your comment is basically take it from someone else, not me.  Or, I don't use police, cut police.  Or I don't use a hospital, cut hospitals.  Or I don't like social support systems, cut those ""losers."""
"Re your line: ""Fake tears from a person hiding behind a fake username.""

I didn't condone what these adults did, and worse, did with no business license. This was not a stay home mom with only her children-she almost killed other peoples children, parents who entrusted them to her care.  You kinda took off on a crooked street there with your Constitutional Rights and so on.  Good try buddy. 

More so-I called it a sad sad sad event.

On that note-I do NOT converse, even from a fake name with jerks so good bye."
"Is this satire?  Pelosi is a brilliant politician?  She's bat sheet insane!!!  And if these ideas were so great, why didn't they propose them 8 years ago?  Stupid stupid liberals."
"I agree that you are ignorant.  Like I said many times now, learn to read.  Nowhere did I say I was not American.  What is your problem?  Are you a troublemaker or just plain stu*pid or both?

By the way, lots of non-Americans have an opinion on America.  Try to think."
Trump exposed as again being full of baloney.
"Lela, for an educated lady and a writter you certainly seem ignorant of basic facts."
"ValleyIsle57>  Just my  point of view from where I sit and listen to all of your punk ass excuses, have you any guts or are you a coward???  I am for one thing not sick and maybe a little scary at times, but you fail to see anything beyond your tiny safe haven.  Grow up and look around.  Do you care if any of the other countries condemn or condone what we do???  They could give a rat's ass, as to what will happen to the US in this situation.  Don't you know that the world basically hates the USA, and it isn't because of Trump, they've hated us for years and years.  I don't need any help nor seek any help, but you my cowardly friend, needs to go suck on your thumb and dream of all your phony love relationships with the rest of the world.  You are a fool.  Absolute FOOL.  Have a nice day."
"Ha ha, HILLARY LOST. All you hillary fools need to be rounded up and put in prison along with your leader. You are all anti--American scum. Perhaps we should dump you in Mexico along with all the illegal trash you let in....if you love 'em so much, go live with 'em. But you are not welcome here, you hate filled Marxist morons."
Tooly O'Tool or whatever her name is may actually be correct in this case. What's  the point of mentioning climate change when trying to negotiate with a bunch of clowns that think it's a hoax invented by the Chinese?
"Simply put, can't fix stupid !"
Humans suck.
all true.  Trump's ignorance of world affairs combined with his recklessness has led needlessly to a possible world war.  Trump is the danger as much as NK.  We need major breakthroughs in diplomacy.  Military options should be off the table.  Trump lacks any capacity for diplomacy.  And is there anyone more pathetic than Pence strutting around in a over sized black jacket puffing out his chest.  Lord save us.
"Boo hoo hoo...STILL stewing about how your precious Rail Fail didn't get the ""respect"" you think it deserves this session and how perhaps...just maybe...NOT everyone thinks it's a good idea anymore as currently planned and that the part-time lying mayor is up to his beady eyes in cow sh!t???"
"You are unbelievable! Trump asked the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's email, he did it on mainstream TV, and EVERYBODY saw it. ""Fake posts""? Are you for real Bill?

"Well, it would seem that Ms. Cormier and her 'bigoted' hubris has allowed her to both 'suck & blow' at the same time...

In fact, Ms. Cormier seemed to feel entitled to make the salacious deprecating   observation.

. . . Wonder why?

Seems that obtuse salacious superficiality is Now the name of the Game."

No wonder you failed to grasp my point yesterday, and instead asked for a citation to prove hypocrisy. LOL"
Loser.......
"To be correct both grammatically and logically, you would write ""The media are the enemy"". But of course, that would imply that ideas, contrarian or affirmative, are also ""the enemy"". Of course we encounter daily messages delivered by diverse media that are ""falsehoods and intellectual garbage"", but the media are the messengers, and we don't kill the messengers, do we? The ""falsehoods and intellectual garbage"" are generated primarily from their source, in this particular case, the new administration and its assortment of liars, prevaricators, and fabulists. Can you blame educated people who transmit this garbage to the general populace for injecting a bit of ""WTF"" and incredulous dismay at the blizzard of disinformation blasting out of our secretive, corrupt, and determined wrecking crew in the White House? No, you can not."
">> ""If you can’t raise me $50,000, I won’t show up, so get to work""

"The now deceased shooter appears to be a deranged Bernie Sanders supporter. While the shooter is ultimately responsible for his actions, the mass media, Democrat leaders, and leftist ""entertainers"" contribute to a divisive, rabid anti-Trump/anti-Republican atmosphere which motivates extremists like this Democrat shooter.

The other big takeaway is that it would have been a massacre had there not been an armed security detail present to return fire and kill the assailant. High ranking politicians (including Democrats) have armed security details, but ordinary citizens do not. Hawaii Democrats deny ordinary citizens their constitutional right to self-defense with firearms, including concealed carry. Hypocrites!

Prayers for the full recovery of those injured in this senseless shooting of legitimately elected officials and Capitol Police officers."
They'll never understand that. they were only shown how to feel about voting for a black guy. I know pathetic but it happened. it's just like how some women vote for a VAG just cuz it's a VAG and not because they are best for the job... I know I am way beyond politically correct but that doesn't mean I am wrong or lying does it?...
"justin is an embarrassment to Canada.

"Trump and his administration embody hate, mysogeny, homophobia, xenophobia and a whole lot more. It's not just appropriate, but morally and ethically imperative that Trump and his nihilistic inner circle be called out over their words and actions each and every time they serve to oppress, persecute or destroy others.  Let freedom ring."

"This is a vile, unbelievable, horrific story and these people are disgusting!! 
I am speechless as to the heinous behavior of this MOTHER & SON KILLERS! This is the most cold hearted, callous act for anyone and then to have the Mother and son do do this together makes me sick. Of course the Mother claims she doesn't know if her underage son was drinking! She reeked of alcohol herself which means, that yes, he was drinking, she probably gave him the alcohol and then they decided to wait several hours for the driver's blood alcohol to go down. He only came forward because there were multiple witnesses!! I am sick. This is some of the most vile behavior I have read, they stopped the car, and he got out and pulled the victim from his windshield and threw him on the ground. They both need to be charged with the MAXIMUM punishment possible. Mother & son deserve to be shot."
Make all these idiots pay the cost associated with this. Make them clean up their own mess & give them a big fine. Why are we letting these people just do as they please. It is definitely sending a wrong message. Wake up you dumb politicians.

"I doubt that the boyfriend is being completely honest.   The situation described is very typical of the triangulation that is one of the favorite games of narcissistic abusers.   It doesn't prove he is triangulating you with another woman, but, given the resemblance to that behavior, the fact that he states she's ""crazy,"" and you don't know any of his friends, sends up a good sized red flag to me.  They always say the woman they are cheating on is ""crazy,"" or something like that.

My advice is, do not ask him to clear up a confusion he has created.  If he is not being honest about the situation, he will only be dishonest again.  Figure it out for yourself.

Most people who have actually gotten away from a ""crazy"" ex do not encourage the crazies by keeping a facebook page or anything else showing a continuing relationship, especially if they have concerns. They get restraining orders.   And most people who use that excuse, ""my crazy ex will go crazier,"" are lying."
"What a bunch of IDIOTS. The most fair and COLLECTIBLE tax is a SALES TAX. 
The success of a tax is if it is widespread, can be enforced easily and is paid by those who actually purchase goods and services. 
The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. 
Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. 
As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive ""toys"", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax."

No reporter  has ever mentioned the support of the atrocities committed by Batista supported and sanctioned by the U.S. government  Done to protect callous landowners of sugar plantations from their own workers. The States sent in their Marines several times to put down sugar plantation workers.

The U. S. dominated and directed all aspects of life in Cuba from the end of the Spanish War to Castro's overthrow of Batista.. Castro would not take directions from the Americans to put Cuba under American thumbs so they made 20 attempts to kill him.

"I wouldn't urinate on Trump if he were on fire, and most likely he does harbor the passive racism of our culture. But as far as this campaign goes, what he said in regard to illegal aliens is spot-on, and echoed by every Mexican national and legal immigrant I know (which are many). They'll flat tell you the ones hopping the border are the scum of Latin society, and they're glad to see them go.

His ideas on ""banning"" Muslims are ridiculous and unConstitutional, but, Islam is an ideology, not a race. It's a repugnant ideology at odds with our way of life and human rights in general, but people have a right to their superstitions in this country. We'll just have to do with those practicing it as prescribed by the founder on a case-by-case basis."

This incident reminds me of the jerks I've watched and heard  at both TSA and Immigration check points at airports.  The clowns who start screaming about everything; especially the ones who yell they are a US citizen and don't have to put up with this."

"So, the Donald saw a twofer - a business opportunity with pretty young women attached, and a pair of suckers to take to the cleaners.  Trump pulled it off - taking candy from a baby.

Get close, and the clay pots are broken.  That is what happened.  This was minor entertainment for The Donald, New York City's biggest trash-sifter.  Who cares about the Little People, right?

"While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia and antisemitism, , Christophbia, Europhobia, Americanophobia, democraceaophobia,  iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal  wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects are worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump"
"Something sounds fishy here.  Why would you leave your girlfriend at the beach alone till 9 pm. and after being with her for only half an hour?
""SOME of her belongings, EXCEPT her cell phone, were still on the beach. ""   Not a very sensible statement . Something's not right.  Best case scenario is she just said, ""screw this jerk who left me out here"" and left on her own."
The losers with sore bottoms are enraged.
This guy is an idiot. He was all in for shorting Canadian banks and probably took many down this road with him. He has now learned his lesson about how well run Canadian banks are.
"Damn, she is looking pretty hot...I'd hit that"
"OMG, you couldn't be more right (wing), the thot that we nearly voted in a woman for President who had some comparatively minor email issues absolutely terrifies me! just think of the cataclysmic horrors we avoided ...now that we'll have somebody infinitely worse than she could have ever been! 

meanwhile, Obama is handing over a national economy that now mirrors the strength of what Bill Clinton gave to dubya and will be succinctly trashed to death again by another vacuous, self absorbed, never right jerk who'll tragically take the unprecedented crown of Thief In Chief."
"Morrow is not the goat!  If anybody is the goat, it is Bradley.  His penalty was so weak it was pathetic. But then again, somebody had to miss."
It is high time the territory of Colorado issue a bounty on these serpents.  Every able bodied man of voting age should do his part and kill one or even two.
"What a load of cods-wallop.  Those in the temperance movement, and make no mistake, that's exactly what MADD is - a temperance movement,  are fond of using scientifically unsound catch-phrases such as ""Impairment Starts With The First Drink.""  The author of this piece is cut from the same cloth.  

Unless we have 0.00 as the only acceptable Blood Alcohol Content, then we must by definition, establish a BAC level beyond which one is considered impaired.  Which means in the converse, below that limit, one is not considered impaired.  It must be set at some level.  

There is no basis upon which to justify a change to 0.05 from 0.08 as being that ideal limit.  This is completely a political decision, not borne of research, science or evidence.  

Wasn't it Trudeau who pledged ""evidence-based"" decision making in his government?  What a hypocrite!"
This couple should have been spayed and neutered a long time ago.
"Ridiculous this is the death nail in the coffin for the Federal Liberals. They die forever now. We are straght up being destroyed, our quality of life is severely deteriotaing and these clowns, many immigrants themselves, in the Federal government are telling us to send in more immigrants?
NO! We are fed up, Heated tents for foreign illegal immigrants, nothing for our own homeless. These people in the Liberal Party HATE US ALL who were born here.
My ancestors fled Stalin. Stalin used foreign immigrants to destroy local populations and remake them as he saw fit. My ancestors fled that, now Trudeau is bringing Stalin here."
"For Russians posting here: it is ""quotation,"" not quote. The latter (i.e. to quote) is a verb.. To cite something someone has said is properly referred to as a quotation (a noun).

"It's fine that you're proud of being a bigot, a racist and a xenophobe, but no serious adult wants that in the Presidency representing our country.  There are simply not enough Klan member types to get trump elected.  In 6 weeks, he'll be ancient history - a bad memory, just like Palin..."
"You are an idiot, with zero knowledge of what you're speaking about. If you know nothing-say nothing. You have no place opening your mouth-so keep it shut with BS like this."

"No, he said hypocrites bad, and hypocritical. Al gore recently said he leads a carbon-free lifestyle. HAHAHAHA. Only the braindead would ever believe that horsepoop. Arrogance allows liberals to say we can affect the climate. HA. human impact is superficial and temporary except for nuclear material. Coastal elitists tell us to do what we say, not what we do. Arrogant clowns that should be ignored, because they have zero credibility."
"Trump is a truly disgusting human being. However, the Team he is building around him in trade and economics is quite credible. It will be America first....but with an eye on the middle and long term.  Slash and burn will not effect us (much) in economics. Hang on for 6 months while the chaff floats out."
"Last Patriot,
 You just described the vast majority of alaska's republican politicians...

He's a good 'ol boy from Texas who has made his political career being a water carrier for outside oil corporations.

This is just another attempt to repackage the same garbage we were sold and call it ""reform""."
"Yes, there is a weary familiarity to Lying Justin's dimwitted pronouncements. Making all Liberal senators independent was just one of the ""ooh-la-la he is so bold"" declarations he made, like not buying the F-35s and running a string of deficits during an expansion. Now everyone is starting to realize they were the imbecilic posturings of an incompetent. The mainstream media should have realized it then, but were too stuck on getting rid of Harper to take much notice."

"Spot on. Stupid people, in large numbers elected, as POTUS, a turd. An ignorant, steaming, stinking turd."
Only thing I learned from this election is that America is full of suckers and idiots and they all helped Trump win the white house.
"That is one of the most idiotic titles for an article that I have ever read, ""...Russia goes from foe of U.S. to friend"". No, Russia is not our friend, has never been our friend, and will never be our friend. They have a leader (Putin) who is at least a thousand times smarter than the soon-to-be leader of the U.S. (Trump). They are going to buffalo Trump and use him to suit their interests at every turn. It will not be in the best interest of the U.S. or the world. Russia doesn't give a damn about clean air, clean water, reducing global climate change, human rights, or anything that is important to a healthy future of all citizens of the world. In that way, Putin is as idiotic as Trump. They have the idea that if you poison the biosphere that somehow they'll be able to escape the effects because they are rich. Haha, the joke will be on them (and us all). No, Russia is going from a carefully watched foe to a foe that will have free rein over America, thanks to the chump, Trump."
Maybe you could use some advice on writing these ridiculous accusations under your own name rather than sniping and hiding.

Get your alternative facts straight. She only cleared it after tweeting about Trudeau. She's an unethical hypocrite with a very nice tan who apparently likes to hang with billionaires.

All these politicians are Democrats or as I call them donkeys. There is no accountability no one taking a stand nothing just raise taxes raise taxes raise taxes. I'm sick and tired of these elected officials who are all talk and no action. They don't even know the final price tag I'd say 20 billion if are lucky. What a complete joke.

wow do you ever live in the world of stupidity
"People are scared of black people because black people can be violent & they will probably beat you up if you annoy them. So I have rarely seen whites or Asians being openly, verbally racist to black people. 

But I did hear my white female high school classmate say something nasty to a black girl who was a nice, polite, friendly girl, not the type of girl who would beat you up.

I have seen white & black people harass, bully & saying racist things to Asians or saying racist things about Asians.

I have seen Asians being nasty to Asians, Asians saying nasty things to Asians, Asians saying nasty things about Asians.

Asians are easy targets for racists & bullies because Asians are less likely to beat you up or talk back to you if you harass them.

Most likely, you will see acts of racism against Asians & Muslim looking people.

Blacks face discrimination & prejudice in school, looking for job, looking to rent a home.

There have been news reports of racist white people attacking blacks."
"So Trump Jr.  agrees to meet with a Russian lawyer and has no idea what the meeting is going to be about.. and asks his brother -in -law to come along?
And he is not too busy to agree to this non specified get together just when his father has won the nomination?
I am sure he got hundreds of meeting requests at this time and can pretty much guarantee he accepted zero without knowing what the proposed agenda  was.

Give me a  bloody break man. I guess his base is that stupid if they buy this load of drivel."
Its all these liberal fools moving here it never used to be bad 😀

So they're busy, busy, busy, trying to find a way to sneak their bullshit past us. Not gonna happen."

"Intel Community: ‘How can we work for a President who Undermines our work?’

Days before taking office, he compared America’s spies to Adolf Hitler’s Gestapo.

American spies do not like having their work dismissed by the president. Nor do they appreciate comparisons to Nazi Germany.

Former CIA Director John Brennan made it clear: “The person who said that should be ashamed of himself,” Brennan said.

Coats’ predecessor, Gen. James Clapper, called Trump’s comments “a terrible, insulting affront … completely inappropriate.”

Trump’s opinions are out of step with the conclusions of the agencies he is supposed to be leading.

Not surprising in a treasonous traitor."

Justin's attempt at a Hi-5 with Prince George was a display of stupidity  George was not amused and just ignored him.   It only serves to demonstrate that Justin really does think on the level of a  12 year old : he relates to children not adults. Hence the Chinese call  him Little Potato.  He is not my Prime Minister.
Anyone who allows Obama to nominate him/her is throwing away a chance to ever be nominated for the position in the future.  Anyone that stupid doesn't deserve the job.
My plan is to not vote for any incumbents. If I have a democrat to choose from I'll vote for them just to try a break up the republican control. By and large I think our current legislature is worthless. Mike Chennalt comes across as dumb as a post. I can't believe the people in his district reelect him.

"You know, I see and hear some folks say that most of our homeless population "" are from here"". The only ""evidence"" I have ever seen claimed is that in some surveys of homeless folks many say that their last ""permanent"" address was here. First, this survey can't possibly have any scientific validity in relation to the totality of the homeless population. Secomd, what that response means certainly has a lot of ambiguity in it. If it is true at all, the next question is to define what ""permanent"" means to them, followed by the question, how long did that ""permanent"" residency last? There are lies, damn lies and statistics. All can be the same."

If you, Gene, had honesty or merit, you'd apologize. No one expects that tho'.

What Trump told Billy Bush was not a conversation between intimate friends. Bush said he went along to get along with ""the star,"" and regretted it. Trump is a pig.

Character is what you say & do when you think no one's listening or watching. Trump is smarmy even when he thinks people are watching or listening. He encourages his followers to attack protesters, saying he'll pay their legal bills. Violence ensues. Big surprise. You're backing a modern Mussolini. Perhaps you'll be able to spend time hanging out together, like Benito and his mistress did at the end of WW2."

"Let' examine the staggering shameless hypocrisy of the political correct liberal trolls running our state school board, and the racist stereotyping they re teaching our children. 
 To appease the PC liberal the Siletz Tribe replaced their Warrior mascot with  feather. The State school board tried to ban the feather claiming it is a racial stereotyping of Native Americans BY NATIVE AMERICANS. That folks is either from a shameless pathological liar, or the dumbest political clown you will ever meet; either or, they're running our schools. 
 The feather is evil, it is racist stereotyping, but a horse is sacred and holy [sic.]
 At a time PC liberals are screaming our schools are underfunded, these shameless intellectually bankrupt clowns have forced the Mohawk school district to squander $10K+ to replace a mascot 90% of us Native Americans overwhelmingly support, 5% could care less, and a pathetic 5% of emotional cripples finds offensive."
"I am a gay man, chaste & celibate, with ""tendencies"" rather than just an orientation or supposed ""disorder"", and a former priest. The dearth of celibate integrated fellow priests was largely why I left active ministry. My experience is that gay priests tend to be more sexually active than straight priests, although both (forgive the binary constructs) are at least periodically active and to a staggering extent. Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes, concupiscence is a function of humanity, so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and, where required, forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests, and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less than integrated lives, give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal, and not merely immoral, behavior. You're only as sick as your secrets; an elite hierarchy calling out this phenomenon as a disorder is more than ironic."
"What an inaccurate, ignorant statement.  Even the biased Hawaiian Studies folks would not make that claim."

We're the people who have:....Ideas, who create business, who hire people, who, above all else, ""PAY TAXES"" to various levels of incompetent governments!   OK, let's refresh....CONSERVATIVES create, most of the ""REAL"" employment in this country and pay the, ""MAJORITY"" of taxes!...

"It is evident that we will transition from fossil to some other fuel(s) over the course of decades, but that will only happen when the other fuel(s) are economically superior to fossil fuels.  And governments attempting to tax fossil fuels up to an uneconomic price to make the other fuels look attractive is a fool's game.  It amounts to subsidising those fuels that are not yet economic.

This much is evident.  But claiming that Trudeau has wisdom and insight does quite follow.  The man is a fool, repeating his lines by rote."
"No, greed is to live in a home built from wood, and then advocate depriving others of a home built of wood, because the vulgar hypocrite thinks all logging is evil, except when it came to building a home for them."

If you say something logical, and well referenced, don't worry, I will respond in kind.  If you choose to mimic Fox News and the baby-in-chief, you better learn to accept the correct assessment of you and your comments.  Don't try to pass of on others the fact that YOU are willfully ignorant and ill-informed - and remember, this is based on the stupid things you say.  OWN IT Groanin.  Oh and I see Golfinguy (who's sensible sometimes, and Sarge (never sensible) like your comment.  Two MAGAphant lapdogs to join you.  They don't like me pointing out their stupidity either."

You’re is one of the dumbest comments I’ve ever read.
"It's amazing that the women who voted for the pussy-grabber in chief - a heterosexual man who bragged about barging unannounced into teenage girls dressing rooms - and other sexual predations, to lead our country, are stupid enough to think anyone believes they're concerned about the privacy of women and little girls, or the ""core values"" of any decent person?"

"It is hard to fathom how you and the minority of Americans who forced this buffoon on the nation could have become so ill-informed. No, every detail I posted as false is actually false, proven to be false. This is not even remotely subject to dispute at this point, it's all been examined so much.

First, it ould be helpful if you could read and comprehend first before reacting emotionally. I didn't say Trump bowed. I know that he had to lower his head. I said he *curtsied* to the king, like a girl, afterward. That's the diversion tactic you right wingers need -- ignore what was said and attack your own straw man. SYria used chemical weapons and Obama responded, and they didn't do it again until Trump was president, then he wasted a shipload of cruise missiles on an airfield that was **back in operation the next day** PLUS Trump called ahead to warn them he was gonna do that. Some slapdown! LOL!!

You have got to be kidding if you think anyone fears crossing Trump. He's a chump."
Youre an idiot.
"Our ignorant, clueless legislators are working hard to ensure that Alaskans are as ignorant and clueless as the legislators themselves are. Stupid Alaskans are the only way these moronic legislators will continue to get re-elected."
Trump called it a bomb immediately. Hillary waffled around and struggled to say anything worthwhile at all. Has she admitted it was a bomb yet?? Another great contrast between Trump and that other lying woman who is always clueless.
"I thought comments were closed is this another tool to censor?

"Here is Trump on 60 Minutes in September 2015: “I am going to take care of everybody. I don’t care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.”

"Margaret, give me a break--to be blunt, in regards to Khadr, both Chrétien and Harper looked bad.  Trudeau's last 2 weeks were fine.  For what it's worth, given Scheer's inane, opportunistic comments--does he really believe the garbage he's saying or is he, as he suspect, just playing up to the moronic Conservative base?-- I will never vote for him."
"Thanks for your thoughtful comments, Hodor.

I think you’d have to be pretty stupid to want Trump to release those sort of things, don’t you? Tax returns will be fine for now.

Oh, and did you hear?? Apparently Trump’s new campaign manager (What, his third??) now says we’re NOT going to round up all the illegals and kick them out en masse as Trump promised. My guess is that Trump was just saying that sort of thing to begin with to attract the Palin-Americans he needed to win the primaries…"

Then you move on ""hundreds of junkies"", claiming they chose addiction. Some, sure.

"What utter garbage! The Globe's editors are showing disgusting authoritarian tendencies with this tripe.

Senators have been appointed to do a job. In order to do this job, they have been given certain powers in full accordance with the constitution of Canada.

If you don't like the manner in which they exercise their powers, that's one thing - just part of the normal grumbling about politics that comes hand-in-hand with any issue. And if you don't like the powers they have, a very simple procedure is open to you: amend the constitution.

But to suggest that they should not exercise the powers with which they were entrusted due to some feeling that the constitution is a flawed document which should be ignored is simply contrary to the democratic process and is the first step to authoritarian rule."
"Indeed! This system is opaque. 

There are ridiculous and wrong comments that are nevertheless civil, and there are uncivil comments that are nevertheless objective and correct.

"Just another attack on the middle class, from the party that supposedly represents the middle class. Just looking at my natural gas bill there are already four different taxes added to the bill. The fuel itself is the cheap part. And the government wants to add some more. Ridiculous. Just look at Ontario where this government is leading us.
I'm starting to think the real solution is a tax on idiots. Undoubtedly within the Liberal party and the voters that elected these clowns there would be enough collected to pay off the entire national debt."

"You don't get it. I am not saying Trump is a great man. Yes he has lied. That said Hillary Clinton has lied her whole career. Heck she even got caught with her comments about having public and private positions. When you look up the word liar int he dictionary Hillary Clinton's picture is there.  Also Bull crap on the sexism, rasism, xenophobia etc. Liberals throw those labels at everyone who opposes them. Sorry but you have cried wolf so long no one believes you.  I am a moderate not a conservative and I know the ways both conservatives and liberals argue their points both has stupid arguments at times.

"Anchor Rides requires a 48-72 hour appointment for every ride.  You can't just call them the day of your appointment.

They will also tell you they can't get you to your appointment at the time you require.  Instead you can go 2 hours earlier or an hour later.Finances are another consideration.  It costs $3.50 for a one-way ride on Anchor Rides.

Well Mr. Trump, we'll expect a few stupid tweets as per normal."
Liberalism is a serious mental illness.
"Thank you for that acknowledgement.  Hillary Clinton, however, did not spew those sentiments during the campaign, or ever, that was a caricature that you fell for; in fact I'm not sure I've ever met an abortion-crazed person. I think Donald Trump has probably promoted abortion more than we'll ever know.  He is a very sexually promiscuous man and has boasted about it often.  I suspect that he has paid for many abortions.  He was also very openly racist, misogynist, xenophobic, and a verifiable liar."

Truly wondrous, …the extent of the indoctrination.

Trump can murder America in the street, (…and he's hard at it.),  and yet his followers won't lift an eyebrow.

They're too busy listening to Sebastion Gorka, or Alex Jones or some other equally crazy loon."
"Your friend is an idiot.

"Why do you keep posting an opinion piece written by a blathering idiot?  By the way, I'm not a pot head.  I prefer scotch.  The only reason that you see more people who do hard drugs have also used marijuana is that it is illegal.  That is the draw for some people.  Make it legal and it looses some of its luster.  Why do you suppose that many people that abuse alcohol also abuse prescription medication?  Is alcohol a gate way to pill popping?  I's exercise a gateway to steroids?"
"Barbara:  I used Trump's term to elicit that kind of response! We need to be reminded that he didn't just speak boy banter, but extreme vulgarity.

The DA's office shouldn't care, nor should anyone else, if the case hangs over the defendant's head and is a burden to him...a man died at the hands of a man trained to use restraint and for not a good reason. realistically, however, if the deadlocked jury was at least 8 to 4 for guilty on the deadlocked charge, if not more, than it should be retried. even a public defender would concede that at that number the DA

When government, under the force of authority raises 'fees' to finance government operations it matters little to us mostly powerless taxpayers what you call it.
Fees--taxes--- or 'revenue enhancements' as Kirk the Korrupt likes to call it. 
We are just sheep being fleeced to feed the bloated government money machine.

"That is a silly argument.  Individually you pay no more or no less than anyone else based on federal tax rates.    Yes, thanks to the natural resources you have higher earning individuals which should be a positive thing, coupled with a younger work force that equates to more taxes going to the country....  somehow to the low information right that is negative (standard right wing mindset) and you choose to complain and whine about it.....so very sad."

"<Trump was a draft dodger during Vietnam.>
The president is a coward and a hypocrite who not only dodged the draft and avoided any and every opportunity to serve, but also -- as an adult, a businessman, and minor celebrity -- expressed his contempt for those who do serve by describing his sexual promiscuity, while avoiding venereal disease, as his ""personal Vietnam"" -- ""I feel like a great and very brave soldier"" said the punk who is now Commander-in-Chief. http://people.com/politics/trump-boasted-of-avoiding-stds-while-dating-vaginas-are-landmines-it-was-my-personal-vietnam/
The flag represents precisely the right to protest peacefully and lawfully; for the POTUS to describe those who exercise that right in vulgar terms and call for them to lose their jobs dishonors the flag and the country and values it represents. It is the protesters, not POTUS, who honor the flag and understand what it represents.

Obama was so bad that after essentially coming to an agreement with the debt ceiling and the budget with Boehner in a meeting at the WH.  By the time Boehner got back to his office Obama had left a message that he had changed his mind and wanted hundreds of billions more in spending.  
Just a few of the points in Bob Woodward's book."

"- The nation lost 31,200 full-time jobs, and gained 34,300 part-time jobs during the month.
- All the job gains were self-employed and public sector. 
- Canada lost 50,500 jobs in the private sector.
- this reflects the departure of 45,500 people from the labor force. About half of those were youth, meaning many young people looking for work have stopped looking.

The poor driver didn't know any better, and it is racist and Islamophobic to think any differently.  If the thought even crossed your mind for a split second, you are Islamophobic and probably should go to jail."

"THANK YOU. I'm so sick and tired of people acting like the military is filled with precious snowflakes that will be oh so very #triggered the minute that someone isn't genuflecting before the flag, the anthem, or the notion of invading yet another country for capitalist interests.


How on Earth did this dumb association get made between such pageantry and people in the military without it getting laughed out of the room on the first day? It doesn't even pass the laugh test....the idea that because someone at some event involving ENTERTAINMENT doesn't do the proper rituals at the proper time would be insulting to those in the military? Ridiculous."

"Bush's incompetence allowed 9/11. Then he put the trillions cost of his illegal invasion and occupation on the national credit card. Then he let the economy melt down thanks to lax regulation of Wall Street, which hugely cut workforce, doubling the unemployment rate, and boosted participation. SNAP (food stamps are long gone) doubled between 2001 and 2009, under Bush. It's gone down steadily since 2013 and is lower than it was in 2012. Don't let facts get in the way of your fantasies, however.  Grade school math and logic have served you well so far, right?"

...Whether measured by NAPLAN results, entry to selective schools or Year 12 Study Scores, the reality is that students from Asian and Indian backgrounds, often with migrant parents unable to speak English, achieve the strongest results...Results in Victoria are mirrored in NSW where Asian and Indian students are the top performers in subjects like Maths Extension 2, Chemistry and English Extension 1.

Not Fake news either. Watch Fox. They are saying similar things as CNN about today's testimony. They can't believe how Trump has screwed things up so spectacularly in the last four months.

Doesn't all the evidence there now is grab your attention? Or are you simply one who thinks it is a conspiracy and that the investigation should be halted immediately. At the end of this, the people of the U.S.A. will not be ""thinking"" much about this single leak we are talking about. They will be wondering how they were ""so stupid"" to elect the self-obsessed egomaniac. And do to the anger and bitterness of his core supporters, the Republican Party will be torn apart. Do you want that?"

We should sit on the gas until a private entity (BIgOIl -?) builds the tankers (when the market is right) & ships the gas from Prudhoe to Japan - much shorter & less risky that the NW Passage. Forget building a pipeline that tears up the wilderness & will demand massive maintenance costs .... if it doesn't bankrupt the state - which is likely.

No rational reading of my post supports this contention.  He inherited the scandal, and is responsible for how he handles it.  So far, he's protected priests from defrocking, failed to meet with victims, accused critics of being leftists and stupid people, has held no bishop accountable and created a commission that has no budget, no power, no mandate and thus can be recognized as a fraudulent attempt to be doing something."
"oh yes there is, millions of them, and they happily voted for trump.

"Another stupid, revisionist comment from the Tween Surfer Wannabe extolling the virtues of White Supremacy, One Religion Puritans, with human rights only for the pale-skinned, saintly gun-packers in the fenced fortresses and bunkers removed from all of those ""other"" humans.

"Knee-jerk criticism of Trudeau over this is ridiculous. For one thing, Brazeau was a token Indigenous appointment by the Harper regime. And he was a Conservative -- supporting the government that was antithetical to Indigenous and most other people's interests.

If you want to criticize Trudeau on the First Nations file -- and I do -- call him out for trampling on land rights in promoting pipelines and mining, failing to remedy water dangers on reserves and failing to deal nation to nation.

Beating Brazeau in a boxing ring was one of the few good things he did in that campaign."

"The morons just can't stop stealing from people. In Canada, up to certain amount of income, we have to give almost 50% of our income to the morons. And for the rest 50% that we keep in our pocket, when we spend it again we have to give 12-15% (gst) to the morons. So basically we are left with 35% of what we earn. And these are still not enough, they work very hard to invent a way to dig more from our pocket.

"That is absolutely ridiculous, as I pointed out in a comment above the government is based on a system of checks and balances, and the President must be held in check as well. He cannot wield unyielding power or else he is a dictator and equivalently as powerful and corrupt as someone like Putin. What he has done is put on a facade that all of you simpletons ate up, as you saw his call for less government and actual change. What you haven't realized in your blindness, however, is that he and a small faction of government officials have been taking complete control of government while forcing everyone else out. He's turning the country into a dictatorship and you should be frightened by that. He is violating ALL the principles this country was founded on, all because an uneducated populace wanted their racial, religious, and sexist bias' justified by a bigot far worse than them."

The permit for the event was revoked before it even started, the alt-right showed up loaded for bear and the police knew it was a riot not a peaceful protest. 

The fact that we keep even having this both sides are bad conversation when nazis are involved is simply amazing to me. They literally killed a person and everyone is hand wringing over the counter-protesters.

The child rape accusation was actually a scheduled court case which was withdrawn because the victim received death threats.  Trump is a man who has admitted he sexually assaults women, has boasted about his promiscuity.  He and our new first lady were recorded on the Howard Stern Show, while they were not yet married to each other, and both of them admitted that they were naked and had just had sex.  That ugly, creepy-looking man is obsessed with sex."

"My first impression of Fairbanks in May of 1990 was ""What a dump. I bet I end up living here."" I ended up living here. It is decidedly not a dump.

After several years in Denali (where I met my now wife) we settled in Fairbanks for better job prospects. Initially I wasn't sure about the place but as I came to learn the extensive trail system the mountain biker in me went nuts. I also found plenty of things to get involved in because Fairbanks residents have to create their own good times. People here are doers. When you meet someone questions don't revolve around jobs, we ask where have you hiked/biked/hunted/fished/climbed/etc. In other words, how have you taken advantage of this place and what it offers? You can go to a party and find a millionaire swapping trail tales with a plumber and they've known each other for years and you can't tell which is which from the looks of them.

As for suggestions, visit in March. There is no finer place on Earth than Fairbanks, Alaska, in March."

The Media had already prepared their glossy covers with her crown in place--

The media still betrayed her--They could NOT ignore (as they had intended) the Republican candidate despite their orders--Trump played them like PT Barnum and they dutifully kept him FRONT and CENTER in the headlines--even trying to ridicule him as they did, Trump's name was in the news daily and the ""deplorables"" (those ignored by the mainstream parties) who were themselves ""mad as hell"" voted their disgust of party politics--hah, hah"

"The Russians got a free pass with feckless and weak Obama, but I don't think it will be the same with Trump. 
He's already publicly embarrassed Putin an Lavrov by stating that they were either outplayed by Assad on still having chemical weapons - when Russia was supposed to ensure he didn't - or simply naively stupid. 
The Crimea was clearly invaded by the Russians and stolen. The Ukriane has already been invaded by Russian forces and weapons, but the fight is far from over there. 
The Russian military is no match for Western forces, except for their tank division. Every other part needs major upgrades and with sanctions, money is tight. 
I suppose Putin's next move depends on what corrupt dictator wants to pay him for support to add to the billions he's already collected from corrupt dictators for his support.

We are STUPID to tolerate these monsters among us in the pretense that we are preserving our freedom.

BTW: You ascribe the responsibility for violence to the ""counter-protesters"".......The most specific act of extreme violence was the driving of a car into the crowd of ""counter-protesters.""  Since many in that crowd were black (I'm guessing not many of the white supremacists/white nationalists were black), there's little doubt which ""side"" was guilty of the violence which caused serious injury and death.

"Regrettably, there are also a lot of uninformed and naive morons who slavishly stalk the internet at the ready to give their knee jerk (accent on jerk) response in support of their hero Justin Trudeau no matter what the issue or the facts or the logic of the matter.   You are one of them and I must say that it is annoying having you click dislike beside my every post because you worship Trudeau not because you have anything intelligent to say in support of your beloved selfie made PM.

I knew a former PM who earned a BA, MA and law degree, spent over twenty years as the best trial lawyer in western Canada, then spent 15 years as an MP acquiring the experience to become Conservative leader and then ending 22 years of Liberal rule to become PM.  He was a brilliant intellect, charismatic orator, masterful parliamentarian, and a consummate Canadian patriot.

One who is not as manipulated by others - a good trait and yet a bad one (doesn't take direction when should).  One who is smooth slick and a political dancer. Liar?,..maybe but yet the master of subtle ""story"" changes to introducing confusion who shares this talent with her husband i.e., his famous reply,  ""well, it all depends on what is - is"".  And the other choice who  portrays both the 6th grade bully and the class clown...not necessarily funny but saying things that are profoundly silly.

Gays are also executed in mass hangings in public squares, by hoisting a number of them by their necks from a crane. Children can then throw rocks at the corpses.  Dundas Sq will nicely for that.  If all else fails to exterminate gays there is still the simple gun shot to the head, or sword to the neck.  It is all Inshallah, the will of Allah.  There is nothing we can do to stop it, because it is Islamophobia to object."

I'm sure he has thought about the issues and I appreciate what he's saying...the angry white males voted for people whose policies hurt them. And yes Pres. Bill Clinton, who was the best Republican President since Eisenhower, did some dumb things in the name of deregulation that screwed up banking and helped create the bubble...but so did lines of credit tied to your house and lower taxes on the wealthy.  The lines of credit created another bubble, one that masked the lack of wages, as people spent their equity. You could buy a car by borrowing money on your home... a really stupid idea, and something Krugman warned about. So yes they are angry, yet if they think Trump gives a crap, they are wrong, again. And they will somehow blame me for their stupidity."

I have a cousin, a wonderful man who is a semi-retired police officer, married for 40 years and had two children who are accomplished adults, and one is married with two children and very active in their parish as well.  My cousin applied for and was accepted for the Deaconate program in our diocese.  After about 3 months, he received a call from someone telling him he was rejected from the program.  They at first refused to provide the reasons why: it took some time to learn that his wife, who was unable to adjust her work schedule, could not attend the required meetings for wives, and so they threw my cousin out.  As if we have too many Deacons  in the first place.  Church idiots."

"One knucklehead at a time. :) I do agree that we now know he was just mouthing off, but the law is written so the actuality of the threat isn't the key, it's the intentional making of it. It certainly isn't out of line for people to take threats seriously until proven otherwise. And during that time, as the statute notes, the person threatened has to live concerned that it might be serious or might not. That's a valid harm and letting people go unchastened for causing it is bad policy and unjust.

The G&M is so fucked up they ask me to approve my own comments.
What makes you think only the left feel that way about His Highness King Trump? The majority of intelligent right-leaners think he's an idiot too. Only time will tell if we've under-estimated him.
Ridiculous.  Said it before...just walk around the Ala Moana Shopping Center's lower floors where it smells like an open sewer.  The multi-millionaires living above never have to experience this particularly foul odor.  Welcome to our Brave New World where entitlement and wealth belong to a privileged few.

"Trump is a mentally ill, narcissistic, delusional, sick, perverted, nasty, decrepid 70 year-old man who was so desperate to become relevant, he ran for the presidency, supported by obscure losers even more desperate for relevancy.

"Really?  How old are you?  I have been to Puerto Rico numerous times and even hired people from Puerto Rico.  I am not an expert, but I do recall over the past few years that Puerto Ricans tried to assassinate President Truman, shot up the Congress and wounded a few Congressmen.  I recall those perpetrators being released and having a parade in the Puerto Rican neighborhood of NYC.  I recall them being hailed as heroes when they returned to P.R.  I also remember well that there have been three elections in Puerto Rico.   The people had a choice of becoming a state (This would have required them to pay federal taxes.  They never paid a cent.) or to vote Independence or to leave things as they are (Get all the free stuff and benefits from the U.S. just as if the whole island was on federal welfare.).  And you think we have ignored P.R.  Hell man, they drove out the Navy which provided Billions to their economy and thousands of jobs and we ignored them?  What a misinformed fool you are."

"Wonderful skewering of the aspiring ""Fat-Shamer in Chief"" by Tiothy Egan in today's NY Times:

""So, in the spirit of the discourse that Trump has brought us to, let’s objectify the Republican nominee on his terms. This guy is fat. Bigly. He’s got an extra chin, a gut you wouldn’t want to see riding above a bathing suit, and a rear that serves no purpose but ballast.

At 6-foot-2, the height that he has long given profile writers, ... [b]y government guidelines, Trump is obese. In a weasel move to avoid that classification, Trump now says he is 6-foot-3, which makes him merely overweight. How he grew an inch, at the age of 70, is a story that has escaped his hagiographers at Fox.

Trump’s ducktail hairdo, colored in a hue unknown to nature, is a complicated comb-over inspired by Dr. Seuss.

Trump’s hands are smaller than 85 percent of American men. No surprise he lies about that.

"Finally, China is getting signals it can't simply do whatever it wants and run roughshod over everyone. The approach of Trump is a little risky, but also has real potential for shifting the tide away from a communist dictatorship becoming the supreme power in the world. I think the Chinese have been laughing, a lot, about the strategic naivete of Western leadership for some time. I don't think they are laughing now. I think they are off balance. While that presents risks, it is an approach well worth carefully pursuing. Trump is not the stupid idiot so many think he is."

Cassidy was a prominent voice in the discussion over healthcare, and pandered to Kimmel's very sympathetic audience, as well as, it now seems, exploited Kimmel's genuine suffering, anguish/fear and conscience over what had happened to his (Kimmel's newborn child).

Cassidy went on national TV spouting all kinds of positions, proomising that HIS approach would not only addres a child like that of Kimmel, but all children.

THEN, Cassidy CO-SPONSORS/CO-INTRODUCES, then advocates for, a bill that simply does not do what he promised.

No straw man.  KEY man.  NON-CREDIBLE man.  And clearly, not a man of integrity or principle.

Do what Cassidy did (exploit and lie), and you get it from those you exploit and lie to.

"The lower dam was apparently plugged by rafting up logs then submerging them by piling rock on them, to form a latticework plug, of sorts, so why not just dredge them out and let the river flow under the dam, then install a gate to store water for times of drought? The upper dam could have been similarly drilled under to allowed the lakes to refill in flood season, protecting downstream property and then used as a reservoir in Summer. We spent millions of scarce tax dollars for the aesthetics of a ""wild"" canyon for a few tourists. Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done, but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking. Now we have to spend millions more each year repairing flood damage and building new reservoirs, which will likely have their own hazards, and the animals and birds that had come to rely on those lakes for habitat had to move on or die.

Dan Sullivan - well done, sir!    Bravo."

Dumb Moron!."
It seems odd that Clinton campaign and Mr Mook  did not miss 15 $ million  from their coffers.  I suspect they weren't paying any attention because of the damned Russians.  I
All we need to know is how to kiss our ass goodby.
That has to be the most idiotic comment I have ever read.
"Trump is such an incompetent mentally unbalanced buffoon.

He's weak."
The spawn of Pierre is tone deaf.  Not a smidgen of common sense exists between his ears.
". . . the title heading in the chapter about his Presidency. . . if there is a world left for history to instruct.

And, everytime you try your hand at supporting that monster, you identify yourself as with him, a believer, supporter, advocate and enabler of all those things.  

A Trumpist, given to Trumpism, and therefore a supporter of racism, narcissism, elitism, sophistry and misogyny.

I know what it looks like when I see it on the TV.  It's ugly.  It has orange hair, flappy jowls, and a comical facial expression of attempted ""toughness"" that comes across as lame and buffoonish.

Look in the mirror.  That's what else it looks like.  Equally as ugly.

The ripples in the water don't help."
Piece of shit
"If they want to kill themselves, then let them.  Then we don't have to pay money to feed and house more trash."
The Chump is a sadist. He takes extreme pleasure in watching people suffer. He makes promises he knows that won't be kept and his reply is indifference or a shrug when questioned about it. His kids will pay for the sins of their evil father and I hope that I'm around to see that happen.
"Absolutely,  we have other pressing issues in our state and don't need to spend the time and money to sort through Kitz's dirty laundry.  Really, what's the purpose.  He's already resigned in disgrace and will never be a factor in politics again.  Let's shake our heads at his stupidity and then move on. Gary Crum"
Stupid clerk.  I wonder if he has been fired yet.
"any time anyone calls trump a seesaw without mentioning hillary's balancing act is offensive. there has never been such a low life lying team hopping scum as hillary clinton, she has switched positions so many times its like pamela anderson was her top advisor."

"This legislative flurry in the Anchorage Assembly and State legislature will result in a lawsuit being brought against the Muni by taxi emblem permit holders and the will win, resulting in tax burden to the property owners so Uber ca make a profit. Stupid in spades."
"Ridiculous! Here's someone trying to help these people out and it's not good enough for them for now. Politics is compromise, but for these idiots that's too complicated. They're every bit as bad as the far right wing nuts who take the same stance, not compromise. Drive by these extremes and get on with it."
Charlottesville plain and simple was one group itching for a fight and another group dumb enough to give them one. Where was Trump Wrong?
"Trump looks like a bumbling fool, and he knows it.  So, he's REALLY dangerous right now.

Hope the ""Generals"" are guarding the buttons."
I wish this moron would have been shot to death by the US soldier instead of the other way around. I hope that 10 million is given to the soldier's family who actually deserve it.
"Commendable hair splitting there, but one Muslims' piracy is another's jihad. 

Islam sanctions robbery, slavery, rape and of course plunder upon all who refuse their desert diety. Sure moderate sects exist, or did exist. The peaceful sects like the Sufi are by and large extinct, victims of the Wahhabi purges when the British played their Devil's Game on greater Arabia. 

The moderates now consist  of lapsed Muslims who don't take it seriously, of course these apostates deserve beheading in the eyes of the Wahhabi trained Muslims. Then again EVERYONE who eschews worship according to the Wahhabi way deserves death and having their children sold in to slavery. 

But just because Muslims implicitly accept this decree, we need to welcome them with this heavy bias intact?"
"Is there a remedy for stupid? Judging by the willfully blind ignorance and jingoistic hatred displayed by many of the comments, including a number which look to originate from robots, it looks to be something like ""viva la revolution"", something which is not likely to end well for any of us."
"Let’s not waste time on stupidity. Only people who were VICTIMIZED should complain or reveal what happened to them. Maybe one day, you will be victimized or your son, daughter, father, mother, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa, cousin, brother, sister will tell you what happened to them & you can laugh at them."

"The EC is now racist.  Hilliary lost because she was simply more horrible than the Trumpster.  Place blame where blame is due, Hilliary was a disaster and too many 2012 Obama voters switched to the Trumpster.  The one time the Trumpster plays by the rules (the EC) the losers try and change the rules.  Can you imagine the pandering by politicians that would take place without the EC?  You nominate a bigger loser there is a good chance they will lose."
"But she’s not a crook, she’s not a liar, and she’s not the screaming reality show candidate her probable Republican opponent most definitely is. 

I have a newsflash for you not only is Hillary Clinton a crook and a liar she is without question the most corrupt candidate for president in the history of our Republic. The Clinton foundation is nothing but a front ... She and Bill the pedophile is it as a clearinghouse for all of the bribes they have accepted over the last 30 years. Dena..."

"Can we safely call them 'losers '?.
Don't they have better things to do, like taking care of their siblings,  do they know what their kids are doing.  Always looking for new and old excuses to attack the manly president. Get it over already. There's a New Sheriff in Town. They lost, America won."
"Oh, the poor little snowflakes... still incapable of getting over the idea that the country doesn't owe the lion's share of everything to keep them happy and comfortable. Whites are the least targeted ethnicity in the entire country - but nooo, let's claim ""victimhood"" because some white jackass in a restaurant wasn't allowed his NP-given right to use violence to protect his toxic masculinity from a black woman's words. The number of Afrikaans-speakers have been growing (which those types in the picture conveniently ignores because non-white Afrikaans speakers now outnumber white ones) - but noooo, let's claim victimhood because it doesn't get treated as if it's the only language that should be spoken in South Africa (when in reality it's still only the third most spoken language).

Really. Instead of pretending to be the ""master race"", maybe a large portion of white people in this country could actually start using what is situated in-between their ears. That would be nice."
"Great job FPD, that guy was in need of a dirt nap apparently and wanted to suicide by officer. I hope that don't hurt your feelings libs. Play stupid games win stupid awards..."

"You know, I just spent the last 8 years hearing the country was headed for disaster when Obama was in, heard the same thing when Bush Jr. was in. Guess what? We're still here.

I don't care about him going off on a woman and man he was friends with, who chilled at his resort, then they started talking crap about him, so? Trump was lying about a facelift, but she did have a chin tuck while she was there? I'm supposed to look at her face and believe that crap? C'mon, don't care. I'm sure they'll get a ratings bump, which was what the whole thing is about, then they can start a go-fund me campaign to pay for their wedding. The whole thing is stupid.

Should Trump be able to hold his water with such idiocy, yes, but he's not like that. Him being a jerk and not acting like other Presidents will not cause the downfall of this country. You are correct, he is mean spirited."
"What a disaster for Alaska. How in the world did Alaskans vote this idiot in again? Do these people actually believe his campaign commercials?  A solid look at the reality of Donny would have opened a lot of eyes.

What a pathetic comment .  one wonders why you'd pose such a dumb question . Maybe it's because he's an Alaskan now.   Who would he be doing the favor for besides liberal Alaskan's who's dream boy got defeated by him by resigning ?  Sullivan is our senator now. Accept it.

No, the point isn't to be an average team that has a hot streak somewhere in the season that gives them a record where they barely hang on and steak into the playoffs.  The point is to be a good team PERIOD that can win most of their games not just during a hot streak anomaly, but throughout most of the season and in the playoffs.  You seem to have completely missed that nuance of my comment.  

Of course it's better to make the playoffs than not make the playoffs.  Of course it's better to have a hot streak than not have a hot streak.  But my point was that aside from that early hot streak, they were an average-at-best team for most of the season.  The early hot streak was the anomaly.  The sub-.500 team we saw after that is what they were for most of the season and heading into the playoffs."
Trump's an idiot.

The FBI admitted as much, but Rush Limbaugh and Shawn Hannity gave the weak-minded among you and those predisposed to Hillary-hating, enough excuses to say that Hillary is still a crook, though you can't point to anything crooked that she has actually done.  But this is rich - a bunch of sore winners, still piling on the loser!  You're still being manipulated. Don't look at Trump while he rolls right over you, look at Hillary! She's far worse!

Instead, as Robin so deftly pointed out, the arrangement is exactly the opposite of what it should be; the oil companies are giving us a ""small cut"" of our oil and keeping the rest for themselves. It makes us look ""PRETTY STUPID"" and that stupidity is not lost on the oil companies. We are basically GUARANTEEING the oil companies survival while at the same GUARANTEEING our bankruptcy.

OMG this is by far the most stupidest comment I have read yet!  Get back to reality here Chris Linder.  Educate yourself.  I know personally why the 76 yr old lady jumped.  I know why another person jumped as well.  NO DRUGS FOR EITHER.  Stupid stupid stupid!  Are you on said drugs?
If you've mowed down that many deer and other creatures then may I suggest that driving a truck isn't such a good thing. I've been driving for many a year and have yet to hit one even though I've lived in deer country for extended periods of time. I can usually avoid them but then in a sloth turning vehicle like a F350 I suspect that avoiding things isn't the easiest.  It's either that or you a crappy driver.

Nevermind that the air we breathe at sea level is made up mostly of nitrogen.  She's a scientific moron.  That's why she's controversial.  She's an idiot and a liar.

"G Street is a pretty busy street in Springfield.   There is a lot of traffic that goes by his house.   It is also just across the street from the entrance to the Willamalane Park, which also has a Swim Center and skate park.   So a lot of people travel this street, and pass in front of his house.

So this is hardly a case of anyone invading the privacy of his home, as you have so falsely claimed here.   They had great big signs outside, and were standing right on the street curb, to get attention from the people driving by.

That's quite a difference.

"Minimum wage was already tied to inflation, which suits business and many employees fine because both knew that was sustainable. Now, we have an artificially created minimum wage that isn't tied to anything except Gov't beliefs of what it should be. Added to that, it will jump over 30% if you factor in the other components of these labour changes. The result will be less people hired, less raises, more automation, businesses relocating, and fewer people risking starting their own small businesses. 
And if you don't want to work minimum wage, do something to better yourself to make more money. Rise up, not dumb down."

http://www.awrsipe.com/Doyle/2011/2011-01-11--paraclete_report.htm

Highlight:

In 1950 Fr. Gerald wrote to Bishop Buddy of San Diego and told him that for the first time in the community's three year history the main monastery, known as Via Coeli (Way to Heaven) was filled to capacity and had to turn a priest away. He went on to state that at that time there were priests from 35 U.S. dioceses and 9 religious communities at Via Coeli.   
Fr. Gerald had a very negative opinion of priests who sexually abused minors. In the 1950's he wrote to a number of bishops asking if they had an island in their dioceses where he could establish a totally isolated facility to permanently house such priests."

And if you are going to post the same childish and stupid and tedious TDS accusation every time someone posts a negative comment - whether provable or just reasonable opinion - then it is obvious to all that YOU are the tiresome troll who needs to get some help.

I guess inasmuch as you are a left wing, Trudeau worshipping troll, you'll get away with this moronicity here.

Pity."
"Great job you dumb twits.  How does the thug life suit you?  No, wait until you've been in prison a couple of years to answer that.  What a waste."
Your analogy is faulty but you're too ignorant to know it.
Strong women?  Where were they when Clinton was sleeping and raping women while in the White House.  I am sick of these women's double standard.  Mrs. Clinton went after these women as well and these so called strong women wanted her and her disgusting husband back in the White House.  I find you all a bunch of Hippocrates!

"As I posted yesterday, I cleaned out my closet during the Broncos game, kept only the Elway jersey and packed the rest up and donated these items to a local thrift store. I stopped in this morning and found that everything was still there. No customers were interested buying or displaying items that present a football team that was once thought of as players with loyalty to their fans and their country. Last season we only had Marshall, a disrespectful punk, who deservedly lost a couple of endorsements for his stupidity before he saw the light and decided he was better off standing for the anthem again. 
@John Elway, I have been a die hard Broncos fan for over 40 years, welcomed you when you joined our team, respected you for being a stand-up guy and loyal American and now wonder what happened to you and the Broncos. It felt like a physical blow when I saw 32 idiots, including my favorite players #88, #10 and #58 disrespecting the fans and the flag. A sad day for all the fans."

"Trump is SUCH an idiot. 

On a side note, I am curious what others think of the idea of providing housing for CONgress in DC?
Imagine where we buy up a bit of land, fence it in and then build some 600 housing to house CONgress families.
Then require that the families be mixed. By that, I mean, that GOP and Dems MUST be mixed up and not segregated. 
This way, I would expect occasional block parties, etc, with kids and parents meeting each other and perhaps the CONgress critters will be talking. 
These guys used to mix regularly in the evening but no longer do. 
So, lets force it."

You're either completely unaware of the damage he's caused, and continues to cause, or too stupid and/or uncaring to understand it. Either way you and your buddies are backing a Brooks Brothers jack-booted thug that is a danger to our country.

"Being racist is not a crime.  Attitudes are not illegal although they can be criminally stupid.  But when someone acts out against someone else because of that attitude it could well be illegal.

But it can be a call to violence which of course is illegal.  We can't yell ""Fire"" in a crowded theater remember?

Calling out liars, who have been demeaning ordinary Americans without a political champion to stand up for them, has made Trump their hero.  I often disagree with the President but I love the way he fights the left.  They are mud throwers and Trump knows how to push their faces flat into the mire."

"Who ever thought you could get a politician in Alaska to do the right thing, for 30 pieces of silver all one has to look at, is, Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court....As the torchbearers and camera crews passed by, Frederick and his friends unfurled a 14-foot banner bearing the phrase: “BONG HiTS 4 JESUS.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 70a. The large banner was easily readable by the students on the other side of the street...The dissent similarly refers to the sign’s message as “curious,” post, at 1, “ambiguous,” ibid., “nonsense,” post, at 2, “ridiculous,” post, at 6, “obscure,” post, at 7, “silly,” post, at 12, “quixotic,” post, at 13, and “stupid,” ibid. Gibberish is surely a possible interpretation of the words on the banner, but it is not the only one, and dismissing the banner as meaningless ignores its undeniable reference to illegal drugs.

"This final dig is a bit gratuitous ""Everybody knows that Justin Trudeau is not about to invite Mr. Khadr to Ottawa and apologize to him in person. He’s too cowardly for that."" The reasons that he will not issue a personal apology to Khadr is the very same set of reasons Wente enumerates in her column. It would taste very bad to most Canadians. I am not sure that is craven enough to count as ""cowardly"" and Wente is letting her bias show with that comment.

Like it or not, Khadr has the law on his side. I think settling now probably means we pay less than if it had actually gone to trial. The fact that a settlement and apology are necessary relate to the actions and decisions of his predecessors: Chretien and Harper. And there was no lack of people saying this exact thing to Harper back when Khadr was rotting in Guantanamo. Trudeau is doing the best he can in a bad situation not of his making.

So sure, be angry and frustrated with the outcome. But blaming Trudeau strikes me as unfair."
Albeit a very dumbed-down electorate.
"Who cares if it happened then, or if we're not to blame. Writing it off as a non-issue cause your isolated political mindset won't allow you to engage anything remotely liberal is naive and stupid.

"Hobby Lobby, the arts and crafts store run by conservative, Evangelical Christians has been caught smuggling nearly 5,500 ancient artifacts from the Middle East.

Hobby Lobby had at one time during their dealings hired an antiquities expert to advise them and they did in fact advise the company and alerted them to the fact that buying artifacts without knowing the source would be breaking the law. 

More than just breaking the law, the looting and selling of antiquities in Iraq has been definitively linked to funding terrorism.

Evangelical is just another word for hypocrite."

   Triggered by Trudeau.

His microaggressions,-- his lies and fraudulent promises even leave Liberal millenials in tears.

Then there are his kilo-aggressions, his putting Miriam/Maryam Al Zedeh/Monsef in charge of democratic reform, as a sick joke, a slap in the face to legitimate Canadians,-- people with real names and truthfully-obtained passports and citizenship.

And as a Kathleen Wynne-, Gerald Butts-type mega-aggression, we learn of Trudeau giving a 5.5% wage hike, and a $650 bonus to unionized federal public servants, at a time when deficits are spiralling out of control because of his reckless spending,-- in an attempt to buy their votes.

We need to make Canada a ""safe space"", from Trudeau. And if they help us take the Liberal garbage to the curb, we'll even supply the millenials with Play-Doh and therapy dogs."

"One attack, by a British born citizen no less, and Doug call this ""New wave"". Let me quote another: 

“Terrorism will not defeat democracy,” Lindsay Hoyle MP, who is deputy speaker of the House of Commons, told the BBC.

Everything the politicians don't like is an attack on democracy. Every war they wage is to protect democracy. You know, the people is tired of this old standard chest-thumping political excuse. 

A few days before this attack, U.S. led coalition, meaning U.S.-UK, conducted a massive air strike on Syria ""Islamists"" stronghold. But it turned out to be just a residence, killing 30 women and children. You don't see one word of this in the 'coalition' controlled media. 

Exact same thing happened in Canada Parliament a few days after when Harper ordered CF-18s to join in Iraq-Syria war.

You keep bombing them, they keep hitting you back. It's the POLITICIANS in charge who conduct this war policy in the Middle East. It's the people who get the retaliation. Stupid."

"A Muslim killed a bunch of folks just a week or two ago in NYC, remember that far back can you?  No launch codes were ""hit"", though he did call for an end to the ""visa lottery"", which sounds like a great idea.

"I reiterate, your ignorance is profound, and why you make ignorant deluded statements like Reagan killed the unions. In the real world, what killed the unions, is the fact so many had been taken over by organized crime.
 To further address your ignorance; before every hire in my lifetime, I negotiated my own wages, and benefits just fine. Furthermore, my Chickasaw mother, ran the medical offices of Reynolds Metals, and the Port of Portland, both of which are union. My mother was non-union, and managed to negotiate better wages, and benefits than the union workers she took care of when they injured themselves on the job. The only people I know who need a union to attain better wages are slackers who let people like me carry their load. People like me always can negotiate better wages our labor produces more than slackers."

"So your belief is that all business owners are idiots who will price their goods where they can get the least possible sales and minimize profit.

Au contraire. Supply and demand predicts exactly the opposite of what you think. Moreover it is not some law of nature.

That's why empirical evidence trumps intuition in economics everytime."
"I've never understood the Republican platform on this. People (including Democrats AND Republicans) aren't going to stop having sex. It just isn't going to happen, regardless of the weird Puritanical fantasies some pro-lifers have. So why not help prevent abortions through contraception? It's not the entire answer but it's a part of the answer. But Republicans, supposedly pro-life (which is laughable) want to eliminate one method that helps prevent abortions. I want to get back to a point where I meet a Republican and not immediately assume said person is an idiot."

This is what happens when you let irresponsible doped up clowns gather.
"If you actually read the poll question, it states that ""the majority of Canadians say the government made the wrong decision in SETTLING the lawsuit"" and ""should have fought the case"". They're not necessarily against the settlement but rather thought that it should have gone to the SCC to be settled. There are lies, damn lies, statistics and worst of all polls. It seems you have to actually read the question to understand the poll."

"Other than scrawling his name on a bushel of photo op/executive orders, has there been a single thing that Trump has touched that has not turned into absolute rat excrement?"
"I spent 8 years teaching women how NOT to end up in court - unless on the other end of an assault charge where they had ripped a shin or the lower lip, or smashed the two fine nose bones right into the brain... Toughest problem was overcoming women's revulsion at the simple yet very effective techniques.  I remember one young female idiot who insisted on walking through a dark park at night to get home. Said it was her 'right'. Sure enough, she was attacked one evening. She fought her assailant off. Never forgot her feminist arrogance. 
Speaking of which...
I can believe you were a lawyer who defended such idiots. No doubt you remember the true story about the NYC cop cross-examined in court by a Defence Attorney as to why he locked his locker at work if he really trusted his fellow cops? The cop's response: ""Sometimes lawyers walk through our locker room.""
Based on your 'arguments' and reactions on this site, I have difficulty believing it was the opposing counsel who were clueless."
This whole family stinks!
these types of beliefs are why america has become a fucking cesspool of selfish filth and greed but this turd will be flushed like the rest.

I wouldn't be surprised if Don young got a pallet of cash like the Iranians got. He is a crook as long as the sun in an Alaska summer.  but really.. Who cares right? he brings in cash from the FED for crap all day long.. cash to pay for state projects. that pays.. wait.. forces us to budget for more projects.. wait.. allows other crooks to over bloat the budget... pushes us to pay for crap we really don't need.. wait... We actually think 1000 bucks will satisfy these fat cats. We're the fools.
A ship of fools.

"Yeah, that 9/11 thing was the British again, all confident after they got away with bombing Pearl Harbor in 1941. Back to the troll farm."
"Oh no!  My argument was bad! Better pretend that wasn't the point I was making and hope no one notices!

Look.  You were hoisted on your own ignorant petard.  The proper response would be to slink away like the russian trolls, not to get mad at someone for responding to your specific argument."
A person would have to be pretty dumb to vote for such a horrible human being.
"Oh no, since Trump is a true elitest - and cares less about the working class, except for what they can do for him - anyone with a brain knew he was going to surround himself with fellow elitest users like himself.  As a narcissistic, egocentric, bullying and strangely personally insecure billionaire who inherited money from daddy and made money by cheating everyone with whom he came into contact, I expected him to do exactly what he did. Only an idiot would think Trump cares about the common working man. Only an idiot would believe anything he says. Only an idiot would vote for him. Only an idiot would support him."
So it's true...all Liberals are in fact mentally retarded.
"What a load of caca!!

"108 and counting...with a ton of distraction and baloney about Hillary, but not one serious challenge to the FBI, CIA, Trump's terror advisor or any of the other official, US gov't. source saying Russia interfered.  And anyone who doesn't understand how serious it is hasn't the slightest clue about how America works and what voting means to our democratic system.  I'm amazed at the ignorance.

And not one credible shred of fact backing up Trump's allegation of 3 to 5 million illegal voted.  Not a single fact.

And nothing at all about the sheer, brazen, shameful, dishonest, disgusting hypocrisy of Trump's Made in America....."
Flip him around and kick him in the balls.

Filthy fucking pigs.
"Trump's a cretin, and so are most of the people who voted for him."
I sure hope the judge put him in the general population in prison and one without a leather workshop. This guy is disgusting and deserves to rot in hell.
Waaaaaay beyond a stretch. Just ignorant and attention seeking. He says this because he's knows the ridiculous media will salivate all over anything negative about him. I also think the case seems legit.
I thought she moved out of state. Still here? Darn the luck. Maybe losing the PFD will finally nudge those those twits along their way.
"From the article: ""many of the nominees delayed by Democrats passed easily and with bipartisan support"". So much for your two bit criminal allegation. 

Dems still can't get over losing the election to the most unpopular non-politician in history. They keep trying to relive November 2016, somehow expecting a different outcome. In grade school most people learned this is bad sportsmanship. Hillary should have asked the Dem Party if they would accept the result of the election, not Trump. Arrogant and hypocritical."
Exactly the opposite. They just post the same garbage. And they were caught many time posting false info.
"Pathetic.

They remind me of the people on the infomercial that slopped the spagetti on their feet before they got the lid that would strain it. Smh"
You both are SICK FUCKS AND SHOULD ROT IN HELL.I HOPE YOU GUYS FEEL THE RAPE WRATH WHILE YOU TWO ARE IN PRISON AND IM SURE SOMEONE WILL VIOLATE YOU AS YOU TWO DID AGAINST INNOCENT CHILDREN .AND THE MAN IN THIS CASE SHOULD HAVE HIS PENUS AND BALLS REMOVED AND HIS HANDS CUT OFF AND HIS TONGE REMOVED AND FOR THE LADY ACTUALLY I CANT EVEN CALL THEM MAN / WOMEN YOU TWO ARE A WASTE OF HUMAN FLESH DISCUSTING .
"The liberals are starting to remind me of the pigs from the novel, Animal Farm."
The Donald continues on his quest to turn the presidency into a dangerous farce. The proffering of unsolicited opinion and quips through Twitter is at once pathetic and dangerous. Trump is about as funny as a toddler with a loaded pistol.
"Raybould-Wilson and Goodale should save intelligent Canadians their pathetic crocodile tears.  Those two and little Juddie are the three most useless individuals in this country.  Let's hope justice prevails and the families of the murdered and wounded soldiers are able to claim the millions Turdeau paid to that most odious of persons, and then at least there will be a silver lining to one of the most disgraceful chapters in Canadian political history."
So you voted for a guy who 'grabs them in the p**sy'. I don't want my daughters anywhere near the new idiot.
"Make sure you fill out your ""selective-service"" cards, boys and girls. Trump is going to need you very soon. Don't worry, Trump loves veterans, he's simply going to give almost everyone a chance to be a veteran.

China does have a lot of bullet catchers, and the USA has a lot of expendable population. China could do with about 600Million less, and the USA with about a good reduction of 50-60M.

Make sure you have a happy holiday season, this will be the last one in a while where you can get cheap Chinese crap.

Draft dodging will once again become the American sport, but then again, when you aren't concerned about quality , just quantity, the usual schemes won't work."

"America IS badly broken and was broken even before the fuzzy election of the yahoo Trump. Given the stranglehold of their defacto two-party system, they need(ed) vision, priorities and leafership that was not provided by Clinton and was thwarted from Sanders. Yes, there are mysoginists and idiots aplenty, but Renzetti needs to look beyond that issue to realize that Clinton and an elitist, war-mongering, conservative Democratic Party allowed the clown Trump to prevail."
"Trump is Bozo driving the clown car. Actually, he might be a passenger, but a clown nonetheless. I digress. BTW, Frum's autocracy piece isn't original. The people at Truthdig (e.g. Chris Hedges) have been writing about this stuff for quite some time, yet Frum gets the press. Check out Truthdig, Wente to get the real lowdown on the US politics."
"cudos to nadda for making the idiot post of the day!,,"

"How about, Stop Giving Trump So Much Free Press Every Time He Says Something Stupid?  The ""press"" is acting like a bunch of simpletons and Trump is cleaning up because of it.

Back in the 60's, populist revolutions were grabbing headlines:  Public action on the part of citizens gained control of a largely free press through direct action, and were able to use the media to disseminate vital information and spread revolutions that affected the way we view the environment, civil rights, and corporate wars---Revolutions that almost upset the balance of power, and made dubious characters like Richard Nixon into flaming liberals out of fear of the populace.

The Powers That Be learned their lesson then, and an increasingly consolidated media has been putting those lessons into effect with establishment-oriented messages and astro-turf movements ever since.  Now it's going the other way with Trump, and our 5th estate has turned into a bunch of drooling idiots."
"Well then the ANC is not the answer. They are corrupt, racist and incompetent. The ANC has been taking SA backwards faster and faster each year. NM and TM were tolerable, but Zuma's ANC is a total disaster. The ANC is the problem, they will never self correct, not one liberation movement has ever self corrected, they have just self served until the country implodes. They do this by blaming the consequences of their destructive actions on an easy target while their blinded adoring fans keep voting for them. The only way change will come is through change, it's not called that for nothing. If you keep voting ANC, nothing will change, it's like turkeys voting for Christmas."

"The alternate reality the Trumperatti and the GOP occupy in order to defend Trump reveals the degree to which Trump’s abuses and assaults on democracy depend upon their willful blindness and complicity.  It leaves little doubt that this enabling will continue, with very troubling consequences.

"The idiots who on both sides who commit atrocities like these are the people who are spreading real hate, but they don't seem to understand that the hatred they create is rightly or wrongly placed on the positions they were advocating.

  I certainly don't blame only Obama.
The Democrats were always supposed to be the party of the working class but actually never were, since FDR. What did JFK ever do for poor workers.

  Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton also let down the workers. They actually voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980.

"What a tedious and tiresome troll and trougher for Trudeau - a TTTTT -  you are, Shore.  And your earlier comment here that you were superior to Margaret Wente intellectually and as a journalist is arrogant and delusion beyond words.   All we ever hear from you are the same old and mainly discredited Liberal talking points, blatantly false and misleading claims about conservative politicians and journalists, and cries for the banning of conservative posters and the concomitant creation of ""safe areas"" for all lefty loons all the time posts.

Give it a rest, Shore.  Besides, Cassie and Chris from Ottawa should be back anytime now to take their shifts as apologists for Justin and The Butts Kissers."
Actually I think that those who voted for him or support him are far bigger idiots than trump is. He is what he is and what he always has been and what he always will be. People who voted for him can't claim that he mislead them.

"Wow, is Kelly really taking credit for this. Research the media coverage of the MGTF takedown on May 4th, 2017 where 52 members of the east side crips (including leaders and senior members of this gang) were indicted and arrested on Federal drug and drug conspiracy charges. They operated, lived and hung out in these boundaries as well as the Welton St corridor. I'm here to tell you Kelly had NOTHING to do with this. It's hard to do shootings and homicides when you're locked up. This violent organization was DISMANTLED on May 4th. Noelle, I can't believe you took the bait on this one. You probably covered the takedown on May 4th. Way to go! You and Kelly should be ashamed. How pathetic!"
So called conservatives! What did you think you were getting when you got together and voted in this little imp?

​​This is just another shining example how inadequate our governance and political system is. We are fully loaded with ​self-promoting ​useless carrier politicians. Pointing fingers between conservatives and liberals will not help. They are equal. We need a new political system.
Just kind of funny the way liberals who like to carry on about how educated and sophisticated and global they are and how the rest of us are just a bunch of dumb parochial hicks always end up unmasking themselves as ignorant blockheads.

The cop that shot him was fired for lying on his job application, not murder. He is still free. How many white folks murdered by black people for political purposes would you tolerate? How many centuries of that violence would you tolerate? What would you do to stop the killing? Would peaceful protest work for you as your response? Would mere suspicion of you having a gun justify a cop killing you?"

"Denby, fellow classmate,  I remember being groped by an idiot on the way home from school.   I got away, I ran, I cried in shock all the way home.  But the fear of being accused of starting it kept me from talking about it these past 65 years.  Who would believe me.  Women our age just didn't talk about it.  I knew of others violated in various degrees and they were silent to the public and family, only speaking out to a close friend.  Things change, sometimes for good.  But for people to say, why didn't you speak out sooner?  Fear, shock, self inflicted guilt.  If for no other reason, I will not vote for a bully!  To give someone credit for picking on weaker or smaller for no other reason than you can, is not right.  DT has used privilege for many obnoxious acts, ill-treatment of employees, sex, refusing to pay for work contracted.  These are a few of the acts that are not honorable, or honest.  This man does not represent me or my principles, or the truths we were taught growing up."

Still, I agree with you. Those who are here lawfully, having gone through the immigration process and been approved, should be allowed to stay. But wait - that's the present case.

I'm still waiting for those who advocate yet another amnesty (if you are old enough, recall the last, ""final"" amnesty that Reagan singed into law in 1986 - the one that would put an end to illegal immigration) to tell us how they would explain this to all those patient hopefuls standing in line for years and doing the right thing by our immigration laws. Stupid? Suckers? Losers?

Still waiting."

"Of all the ""western societies"", Japan doesn't seem to have a Muslim terrorist problem.  This is because they DO NOT ALLOW the immigration of Muslims.

Sorry, but terrorism is ""baked into"" that religion, and the Japanese know and understand this.  They don't consider it as being racist, they consider it being common flipping sense.  

When their holy book (the Koran) specifically instructs its followers to ""kill the infidels"", there can be only one eventual outcome (murder via terrorism)."

"It's the economy stupid .....

But not the traditional analysis 

We are living with taxation saturation 

By any reasonable standard, taxation on individuals on over half of what they earn is outrageous

You can talk the middle class talk all you want , but the greatest  source of expenditure is taxation , not the mortgage or car payment 

People have figured this out , and they are furious :  the difference in your life style is actually your government's reaching into your pocket and undermining your ability to take care of your family :   To save and to plan for retirement, to reduce consumer debt , all in the name of the greater good ?

Don't we all have bills to pay , children to educate and concerns about our economic future ?

Do we actually see the RRSP and TFSA limits as adequate to the task ?

And CPP at a $1000/ month ?

Absent a pension, no wonder there is anger and anxiety about these proposals 

And by the way, how is the market treating you lately?

Yea... I thought so"

Sarah was   there, not   Craig,  and  not  you, or  I  or  anyone  else.  Crap  like that  happens   umpteen times  a day,  in Nome,  Fairbanks,  Anchorage,  Juneau  and  every other  town, city, village  in or out  of   Alaska.       Yes, it  is often  due to  substance  abuse,  which  could be  anything    from   homebrew    to    legally purchased  alcohol,  or  further  into  illegal  drugs.  

The  fact  that  it is  Nulato  and during  the Iditarod   doesn't  change the  fact  that  this  sort  of  crap  behavior   also  occurs   everywhere  humans   choose to  be stupid.  The  thousand  miles  between   Anchorage and  Nome  are  safer  than  staying  11  days in Anchorage."

The few that supported him are quite obtuse in their thinking and know little about the world. The majority have bee beside themselves wondering, what I've know since Nov 9th, ""how do we get rid of this buffoon?""
Well. I've said from the start, list his ""promises"" and hold him to them, it's that simple. He can't get anything done because he doesn't' know how to work in a non-unilateral environment. 
The end is near."
"The parallels between the ANC and the Sicilian Mafia are glaring. The ANC has always been run by a few ""families"" who treat the state as 'turf' ; as just one big piggy bank for their self-enrichment. The government basically believes we all just work for them. They aren't a democratic government at all, but use the appearances of democracy to give their entitlement practices a mask of legitimacy. The poor and ignorant have been fooled for so long, but people are slowly coming to the ANC for what it is: a self-serving Mafia!"

"Former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been under near constant investigation since the mid-90's..yet she handles it as part of life and part of her chosen career...
Donald J. Trump has been under investigation for less than 150 days and he is just not handling it very well at all..and his supporters are so strange to try and defend him in public..I would feel sorry for the entire crap show were they not so incessantly incoherent and argumentative.."

You might be right.  The Donald sure was stupid to give them so much publicity.  The Donald is getting a bit stale though with his petty attacks.
"Sheesh when I was in middle school (not too terribly long ago, early 1990's) a simple fight got you suspended for a few days. That was IT.

"This crazy woman has no place in civil society, much less public office. She is a malignant person who doesn't understand how to be respectful to an 11-year old Cub Scout.

Shame one this woman and her constituents for electing her."

"How does it make sense for a free enterprise coalition to take over government as the Liberals did in BC? The results were disastrous. Now they want to do it all over again. Isn't it better for free enterprise to compete in a non-partisan environment and get contracts based on merit and track record instead of smarmy back room deals? The free enterprise coalition even robs free enterprise! As was clearly evident when Clark grabbed the NDP throne speech - the Liberals have no inclination whatsoever to act on behalf of public interests. They put us on the road to a fascist dictatorship. If big corporations are going to dominate government, then let them fold when the government folds. They are fools."

"Get real.  

Who believes Comey told Trump he's not under investigation?

Comey, as head of the FBI was investigating Trump's ties with Russia and possible (likely) collusion with Russia in interfereing in the election.  He was also investigating Trump's team.  You're dreaming if you think Trump wasn't directing them every step of the way. 

Trump is a pathological liar and unbelievably stupid.

I rest my case."

Obama has been an unmitigated disaster. The country cannot afford another one. Hillary is another one.
"Obama is the racist.

When white racist Dylann Roof tragically murdered nine black Christians in Charleston, South Carolina, 
Obama said:   “The motivations of the shooter remind us that racism remains a blight that we have to combat together.” 
 
Yet, when homosexual black racist Vester Lee Flanagan, whose alias was “Bryce Williams” during his failed career in journalism, viciously gunned down a reporter, Alison Parker, and a cameraman, Adam Ward, only because they were white,  Obama said:  “The number of people who die from gun-related incidents around this country dwarfs any deaths that happen through terrorism.”

I would say that Forest Trump is a complete idiot but I do not even think he is complete. He can and will get worse as he uses his power to make even his stupidity controlling. The sooner the US can rid themselves of this festering sore the better off they will be.
Ridiculous article.  As if the Conservatives have to pander to visible minorities who make up 20% of the population.  White voters make up 80% of the population.  That is who the Conservatives need to target.  Trump did and he was elected.

Different truths? There is only one truth. The only ones the media is lying to is themselves. People are on to them. They think we are stupid. Media credibility is out the window. And it's their own fault. Get rid of the paid media actors and put in some people with integrity. Nothing but propaganda is being put out buy these people. And we all know that propaganda is to promote a political view. Plain and simple.
"@Big:  Give your head a shake.  Trump lied about those 3 confirmations.  Everything we know about Comey tells us he would never comment on an on-going investigation. 

Trump is a liar and he lied about this.  Don't be so ridiculously naive."

"Haha, I'm not.

Do you know what the definition of the word bigot is? It's an intolerance for anyone's ideas that are not your own. You fit this to a T. I am not anti Republican, or anti conservative. I've been a card-carrying member of both major political parties, as well as voted for a number of third party candidates. 

I am not anti anything, except when someone is out there pointing their fingers and spewing bigoted assumptions as though they are facts. 

I don't make posts like ""haha stupid inbred conservatives can't read that's why they elected Trump!"" In fact I've been quick to accept corrections and freely admit agreement.

You're the one saying: ""Stupid snowflakes, Liberalism is a mental disorder"" any chance you get.

I'm just in the center and try to be pragmatic, that's why I sound extreme to you: you're on the fringe. You're keep trying to shove a square peg through a round hole because you think the world works in black and white ""us vs them"" ways. It doesn't."

"Canadian $ should have gone up by one half cent per one dollar increase in oil...we should be upper 80's. For those of you that think that a lower loonie makes Canada more competitive..you are dreaming the fool's dream. A 75 cent $ means you all took a 33% cut in your salaries/wages and your living standard is going down fast. And as for  the seniors, your net worth has gone down 15% under Trudeau. Time Canadians woke up and assessed their net worth on an US$ basis.  Doing same on a Canadian $ basis is totally stupid."
The DOW is up because trump appointed the top dogs from Goldman Sachs to run the financial offices of his administration. Seems like only yesterday that Clinton was being hammered for giving speeches to Goldman Sachs conventions but now you and your fellow travelers are mute about the buffoon filling his cabinet with the very billionaires and lobbyists he said he would rid DC of. What's up with that hypocrisy deplorable?
